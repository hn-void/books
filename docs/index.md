# My Record of Reading

| Title | Author | Understanding | (My Personal) Rating | Date | Genre | Comment |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Unfu\*k Yourself | Gary John Bishop | 90 | 75 | 20210328 | Self-Help, Spirituality | includes some interesting thoughts |
| HTML&CSS design and build websites | Jon Duckett | 70 | 90 | 20210316 | Web | This book covers fundamental knowledge to practical tips. I believe it is good for a newbie web developer. |
| Flask Web Development | Miguel Grinberg | 70 | 100 | 20210222 | Web | Mr. Miguel Grinberg has a repository with concrete codes about this book on GitHub so that I can check if I go right. It's cool. |
| Version Control with Git| Jon Loeliger&Matthew McCullough | 60 | 100 | 20210209 | Technology for SWE | Really helpful |
| Essential English Words for The TOEFL Test | AmEnglish.com, Inc. | 80 | 100 | 20210103 | English | Beneficial for catching up with native English speakers |
| Introducing GitHub | Peter Bell & Brent Beer | 95 | 70 | 20201224 | Technology for SWE | This book is perfect for a non-programmer who wants to know how software engineers in his/her company collaborate. However, there is nothing special for ordinary SWEs. If you are an entry-level programmer and entirely new to Git concepts, it is good to skim this book. |
| You Are a Badass| Jen Sincero | 70 | 35 | 20201219 | Spirituality | Nothing is objective. I'm not a religious person, so this book doesn't look helpful to me. I know some types of people need and love this type of book. This book is just not for me. |
| Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do you See? | Bill Martin Jr / Eric Carle | 80 | 100 | 20201212 | Picture Book | Wonderful pictures |
| 2500 Advanced English Words for the TOEFL Test | AmEnglish.com, Inc. | 80 | 100 | 20201207 | English | Beneficial for catching up with native English speakers |
| The Very Hungry Caterpillar | Eric Carle | 80 | 100 | 20201116 | Picture Book | Awesome pictures |
| The Art of the Good Life | Rolf Dobelli | 90 | 80 | 20201114 | Self-Help | Almost all topics in this book are not fresh for mature people, I guess. |
| 12 Years a Slave | Solomon Northup | 95 | 90 | 20200716 | History | Very helpful for understanding actual slavery. This book is made into a movie, but the film really exaggerates the facts. |
| A Random Walk Down Wall Street 11th | Burton G. Malkiel | 65 | 90 | 20200518 | Finance | Bible of investment. You need to read this book before starting an investment, even though its contents are somewhat redundant. |
| Rich Dad Poor Dad | Robert T. Kiyosaki | 90 | 70 | 20200401 | Finance & Spirituality | Interesting, but consists of nothing |
| Programming in Haskell 2nd edition | Graham Hutton | 35 | 100 | WIP | Computer Science | |
| problem solving with algorithms and data structures using python | Bradley N. Miller, David L. Ranum | 60 | 90 | WIP | Computer Science | |
